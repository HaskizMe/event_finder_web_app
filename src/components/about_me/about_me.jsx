                        <p>My name is Bailey Haskell, and I am a dedicated student with a strong 
                            passion for technology and software development. Over the past four 
                            years, I have immersed myself in coding, constantly expanding my 
                            knowledge and honing my skills. My journey has been fueled by a particular 
                            enthusiasm for mobile app development, especially using the Flutter 
                            framework, which allows me to create dynamic, cross-platform applications 
                            that deliver seamless user experiences.</p>

                        <p>In addition to mobile development, I have also explored the exciting 
                            world of embedded systems. Working on projects that merge hardware 
                            and software has deepened my understanding of how technology can 
                            interact with the physical world, and I enjoy the challenges and 
                            problem-solving opportunities these systems provide.</p>

                        <p>As a learner who thrives on innovation, I am always seeking ways to 
                            refine my abilities and contribute to meaningful projects. Whether itâ€™s 
                            designing intuitive mobile applications or working on complex embedded 
                            systems, I am motivated by the potential to create impactful solutions 
                            that bridge creativity and functionality.</p>

                            <p>I began my educational journey at Ensign College in Salt Lake City, 
                                where I earned my associateâ€™s degree in Computer Science. During my 
                                time there, I developed a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, 
                                and the principles of computing. Ensign College provided me with 
                                valuable hands-on learning opportunities that fueled my passion for 
                                technology and innovation.</p>

                            <p>After completing my associateâ€™s degree, I transferred to Utah Valley University 
                                (UVU) to further my education. At UVU, I have been expanding my expertise in 
                                advanced computer science topics while engaging in projects that challenge me 
                                to think critically and apply my skills creatively. With a strong emphasis on 
                                practical application and collaboration, UVU has allowed me to refine my abilities 
                                and grow as a developer.</p>
                            
                            <p>I am on track to graduate in December 2025 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, 
                                and I am excited to leverage the knowledge and experiences Iâ€™ve gained throughout 
                                my academic journey in my future endeavors.</p>

                        <p>I have worked on a variety of projects, from building mobile apps with Flutter 
                            to developing intelligent systems using embedded hardware and AI models. 
                            These experiences have enhanced my technical skills and fueled my passion 
                            for solving real-world problems with innovative solutions.</p>

                        <h4 style={{marginBottom: 0}}>Golf Swing Accelerator</h4>
                        <p>I developed a mobile app that connects to an embedded system 
                            via Bluetooth to analyze a userâ€™s golf swing. The app measures 
                            swing acceleration and position, providing real-time feedback on 
                            speed and distance to help users refine their performance.</p>

                        <h4 style={{marginBottom: 0}}>AI Fall Detection Bot</h4>
                        <p>I created an AI-powered fall detection system that uses advanced posture analysis to identify potential falls. 
                            It sends real-time alerts with confidence scores, ensuring quick responses to detected incidents.</p>

                        <h4 style={{marginBottom: 0}}>Pain Drain App</h4>
                        <p>I designed a mobile app that lets users control a PainDrain device. The app manages 
                            settings for heat, cooling, TENS, and vibration, providing targeted pain relief 
                            through a simple and intuitive interface.</p>
